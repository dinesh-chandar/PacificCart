                   <p> The website was established in 2021, understanding the needs and problems of the people during the pandemic. Pacific Cart thus provides a wide range of products that can be delivered to your door step, thus making it completely convenient for all our costumers, since the costuners' satisfaction is our top priority.

                    <p>When people were hopping from one store to another for best bargains, risking their lives during the pandemic, Pacific Cart was being developed as a budget-friendly online bazaar in India. Pacific Cart was then given a shape and strategy as India’s most costumer friendly, Fully Managed Marketplace

                    <p>Pacific Cart brings the experience of India’s Flea Markets online, in the form of its weekly properties - Sunday Flea Market, Refreshing Monday Sale, Triple Value Friday Sale, and Wednesday Brand Bazaar. Another property capturing the essence of regional Indian shopping, called NRH (National Regional Heritage) gives a sneak-peek into India’s Cultural Gullies at very reasonable prices. These online markets showcase products with range so wide, and prices so low, that they beat the offline neighbourhood markets of India. The concept especially works incredibly well with the middle class population habituated in tier 2 & 3 cities.
